This is a dummy root certificate file for PostgreSQL. To enable client side
authentication, add some certificates to it. Client certificates must be signed
with any certificate in this file to be accepted. 

A reasonable choice is to just symlink this file to
/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem; in this case, client certificates need to
be signed by the postgresql server certificate, which might be desirable in
many cases. See

  file:///usr/share/doc/postgresql-doc-8.3/html/ssl-tcp.html

for details (in package postgresql-doc-8.3).
