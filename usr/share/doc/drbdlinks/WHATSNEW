      (Patch provided by Robert Scheck)

Version 1.15 -- Sun Apr 19, 2009

Fixing a bug in drbdlinksclean init script which would cause clean to fail
      if there was no "/etc/drbd.conf".  Switched to check drbdlinks.conf
      instead.  Fix by Stefan Seifert.

================================
Version 1.14 -- Fri Jan 23, 2009

Option to restart crond after links have changed.
Adding patch from Heiko Schlittermann to add a "list" argument which dumps
      a list of the drbdlinks information for use with scripts that need
      this information from the configuration file.

================================
Version 1.12 -- Thu Sep 04, 2008

Added OPTIONS and EXAMPLES sections in the man page (Mike Loseke)
Log debugging information via syslog.
Added "cleanthisconfig" config command.  This is meant to be used in a
      system with multiple drbd mountpoints, started at different times.
      Each one would typically have it's own config file, which may not be
      available at system boot.  drbdlinks will now copy these files off to a
      safe location when it starts, and drbdlinksclean will run any of these
      it finds in addition to the normal drbdlinks.conf.
Adding a "/var/run/drbdlinks/configs-to-clean" directory, any config files
      that are in there will get cleaned by "drbdlinksclean" at system boot.
Modified monitor option so that it returns "stopped" instead of
      "not configured" if there is no configuration file.  Required for the
      multiple configurations.

================================
Version 1.11 -- Mon Dec 24, 2007

Add option to make mountpoints shared using "mount --make-shared".
Changing error writes to use syslog as well stdout.

================================
Version 1.09 -- Sat Aug 11, 2007

Look for init.d/rsyslog as alternative syslog start script to normal
      syslog.  Suggested by Michael Mansour.

================================

================================

Adding a "monitor" and "status" mode to drbdlinks which check to ensure
      that all links are up.  Suggested by Cyril Bouthors.

      Bouthors.
