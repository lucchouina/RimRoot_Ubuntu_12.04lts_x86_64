WHAT IS IT?
===========

<from the homepage>:
ipcalc takes an IP address and netmask and calculates the resulting
broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range. By giving a
second netmask, you can design sub- and supernetworks. It is also
intended to be a teaching tool and presents the results as
easy-to-understand binary values.

Enter your netmask(s) in CIDR notation (/25) or dotted decimals
(255.255.255.0).  Inverse netmasks are recognized.  If you omit the
netmask ipcalc uses the default netmask for the class of your network.
Look at the space between the bits of the addresses: The bits before
it are the network part of the address, the bits after it are the host
part. You can see two simple facts: In a network address all host bits
are zero, in a broadcast address they are all set.

The class of your network is determined by its first bits.

If your network is a private internet according to RFC 1918 this is
remarked.  When displaying subnets the new bits in the network part of
the netmask are marked in a different color The wildcard is the
inverse netmask as used for access control lists in Cisco routers.

Do you want to split your network into subnets? Enter the address and
netmask of your original network and play with the second netmask
until the result matches your needs.

You can have all this fun at your shell prompt. Originally ipcalc was
not intended for creating HTML and still works happily in
/usr/bin/ :-)



DOCUMENTATION
=============

There is none, and you shall find that none is necessary. The scripts
provide verbose usage output when run without the correct arguments,
so just go ahead and play with them.



Keep the good times rollin'
