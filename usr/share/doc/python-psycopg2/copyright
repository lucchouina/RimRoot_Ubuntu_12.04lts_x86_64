Proprietary licenses:

    A non-exclusive license is available for companies that want to include
    psycopg in their proprietary products without respecting the spirit of the
    GPL. The price of the license is one day of development done by the author,
    at the consulting fee he applies to his usual customers at the day of the
    request.

    for more information about this license.
