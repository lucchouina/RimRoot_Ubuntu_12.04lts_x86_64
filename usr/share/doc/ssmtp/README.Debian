ssmtp for DEBIAN
----------------

This is a secure, minimal mail sender.

There is one configuration file in /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf where all parameters
are set. Support for debconf has been added, so to change the parameters use
the command "dpkg-reconfigure ssmtp".

SSMTP also supports reverse aliases if the file /etc/ssmtp/revaliases is
present. See ssmtp(8) for details.
