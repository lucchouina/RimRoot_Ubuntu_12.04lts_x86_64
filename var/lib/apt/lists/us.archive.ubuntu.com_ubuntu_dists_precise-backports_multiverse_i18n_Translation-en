Description-md5: 6e0625247955d16f5c815fea6934b5fa
Description-en: metapackage for AMD/ATI OpenCL-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.
 .
 This package is not perfect, yet. A major problem for the moment
 is the availability of the OpenCL driver for 32bit binaries for
 amd64. If this is planned, install the amd-app package provided
 through the AMD developer forum.

Description-en: Utility for creating Java Debian packages
 This package provides the capability to build a Debian package from
 a Java binary distribution by running make-jpkg <java binary archive file>.
 (with archive files downloaded from providers listed below)
 .
 Supported java binary distributions currently include:
   * Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) :
     - The J2SE Development Kit (JDK), version 6 (update >= 10), 7
     - The J2SE Runtime Environment (JRE), version 6 (update >= 10), 7
     - The J2SE API Javadoc, version 6 (update >= 10), 7
 (Choose tar.gz archives or self-extracting archives, do _not_ choose the RPM!)
 .
 Please note that Debian recommends the use of openjdk-6-jdk/openjdk-6-jre
 or openjdk-7-jdk/openjdk-7-jre. java-package will install non-free packages.

Package: lgeneral
Description-md5: 1fbf9fae841ca4db79f72e16abe36057
Description-en: strategy game in the tradition of Panzer General
 LGeneral is a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Panzer General.
 You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn against a human
 player or the AI.
 .
 Entrenchment, rugged defense, defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender,
 unit supply, weather influence, reinforcements and other implementations
 contribute to the tactical and strategic depth of the game.
 .
 This is the game engine only. LGeneral requires lgc-pg, which converts the
 game data of the original Panzer General game, to function properly.

Package: python-pycuda
Description-md5: 999e10331c8e1f852d56bf92b2010d4b
Description-en: Python module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.
