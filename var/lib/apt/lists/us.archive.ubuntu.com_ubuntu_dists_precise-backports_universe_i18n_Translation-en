Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Package: blhc
Description-md5: 677f2a00e31e316c282b8bf13f2fbe19
Description-en: build log hardening check
 Perl tool which checks build logs for missing hardening
 flags. Hardening flags enable additional security features in the
 compiler to prevent e.g. stack overflows, format string
 vulnerabilities, GOT overwrites, etc. See e.g.
 <http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags>.
 .
 Because most build systems are quite complicated there are many
 places where compiler flags from the environment might be ignored.
 The parser verifies that all compiler commands use the correct
 hardening flags and thus all hardening features are correctly used.
 .
 It's designed to check build logs generated by Debian's
 dpkg-buildpackage (or tools using dpkg-buildpackage like pbuilder or
 the official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing
 hardening flags in their packages.

Description-en: predictor of protein ligand binding sites from structure and conservation
 ConCavity predicts protein ligand binding sites by combining evolutionary
 sequence conservation and 3D structure.
 .
 ConCavity takes as input a PDB format protein structure and optionally
 files that characterize the evolutionary sequence conservation of the chains
 in the structure file.
 .
 The following result files are produced by default:
  * Residue ligand binding predictions for each chain (*.scores).
  * Residue ligand binding predictions in a PDB format file (residue
    scores placed in the temp. factor field, *_residue.pdb).
  * Pocket prediction locations in a DX format file (*.dx).
  * PyMOL script to visualize the predictions (*.pml).
 .
 ConCavity has many features.  The default run of concavity is equivalent to
 ConCavity^L in the paper:

Description-en: Debhelper (and CDBS) modules for building configuration packages
 This package contains a system of modules for creating Debian
 configuration packages: packages that configure an existing Debian
 system by using dpkg-divert on configuration files.  These modules
 attempt to make the process of creating configuration packages
 efficient by checking the md5sums of upstream configuration files
 that are to be modified and automatically generating the relevant
 postinst code to perform the diversions using the standard debhelper
 mechanism.  In addition to a debhelper command and sequencer extension
 module, CDBS modules are also included, but future development will
 focus on the debhelper interface.
 .
 The config-package-dev modules are optimized for site defaults (i.e.
 configuration for a university or a company), though they are useful
 for other applications as well.

  * Shannon entropy
  * Shannon entropy with property groupings (Mirny and Shakhnovich 1995,
    Valdar and Thornton 2001)
  * relative entropy with property groupings (Williamson 1995)
  * von Neumann entropy (Caffrey et al 2004)
  * relative entropy (Samudrala and Wang 2006)
  * Jensen-Shannon divergence (Capra and Singh 2007)
 .
 A window-based extension that incorporates the estimated conservation of
 sequentially adjacent residues into the score for each column is also given.
 This window approach can be applied to any of the conservation scoring
 methods.
 .
 The program accepts alignments in the CLUSTAL and FASTA formats.
 .
 The sequence-specific output can be used as the conservation input for
 concavity.
 .

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 318a323582f36b363618a66d35f8beb4
Description-en: Worms style game
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

Description-md5: ddcdf9070612e9885f41dd0384fb9f2c
Description-en: utility for IPMI control with kernel driver or LAN interface
 A utility for managing and configuring devices that support the
 Intelligent Platform Management Interface.  IPMI is an open standard
 for monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of hardware
 that is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS.  The
 service processor (or Baseboard Management Controller, BMC) is the
 brain behind platform management and its primary purpose is to handle
 the autonomous sensor monitoring and event logging features.
 .
 The ipmitool program provides a simple command-line interface to this
 BMC.  It features the ability to read the sensor data repository
 (SDR) and print sensor values, display the contents of the System
 Event Log (SEL), print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory
 information, read and set LAN configuration parameters, and perform
 remote chassis power control.

 If you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use. If
 you write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
 replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running jobs in
 parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU Parallel will
 often make the command easier to read.
 .
 GNU Parallel also makes sure output from the commands is the same
 output as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This
 makes it possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other
 programs.
